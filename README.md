# workflow-learn
More accurately titled `workflow-read` - accepts Markdown text as input, and creates a ChatGPT-style animation from it.

Being presented with a large wall of text can be quite confronting - so `workflow-learn` aims to help that by breaking up the text into chunks, and shows them at a fast but random pace to maintain attention. Can be useful for reading documents that require attention to detail, or to revise notes last-minue.
